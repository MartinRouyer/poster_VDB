# The diversity and function of sourdough starter microbiomes

*https://elifesciences.org/articles/61644#s4*

### Abstract :
Humans have relied on sourdough starter microbial communities to make leavened bread for thousands of years, but only a small fraction of global sourdough biodiversity has been characterized. Working with a community-scientist network of bread bakers, we determined the microbial diversity of 500 sourdough starters from four continents. In sharp contrast with widespread assumptions, we found little evidence for biogeographic patterns in starter communities. Strong co-occurrence patterns observed in situ and recreated in vitro demonstrate that microbial interactions shape sourdough community structure. Variation in dough rise rates and aromas were largely explained by acetic acid bacteria, a mostly overlooked group of sourdough microbes. Our study reveals the extent of microbial diversity in an ancient fermented food across diverse cultural and geographic backgrounds.

### Data :
Files : 
metadata500_starters.csv : métadonnées sur le levain, ses process, son origine ...
sourdough_tab_16S.csv / sourdough_tab_ITS.csv : sample en colonnes par les asv en lignes, méthode : We then rarefied the ASV tables to 1260 bacterial reads per sample and 4000 fungal reads per sample and converted to percent relative abundances
sourdough_tax_ITS.csv / sourdough_tax_16S.csv : taxonomy for all asv
sourdough_repset_16S_v2.fasta / sourdough_repset_ITS.fasta : sequences for all sourdough
